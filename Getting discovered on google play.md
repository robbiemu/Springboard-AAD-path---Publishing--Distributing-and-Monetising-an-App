Purpose: increasing inflow for apps on google play store.

### google play store vision

> "Personalized Play made Personal"

* dynamic, user oriented interface
* designed to showcase apps, for the health of android
* targetted for the good of app developers

### google's discovery mechanisms

Search and browsing lists are main install sources

top lists: (brose and dicovery features)
* charts
* personal recommendations
* related/cross-sale (users who viewed also viewed..)

search:
* categorical (games, other tasks, etc)
* navigational (know the app directly, and navigate to it through a larger category or listing of a publisher's apps)

50% of users search for apps on any given week
12% on any day
6M+ unique search strings

#### How it is processed

Google spends a lot mroe time looking for good apps than in lookin for and pushing aside bad apps.

Meta data may help classify the app.

key features in control of the publisher
* Short, clear title - may help tie the idea of the pp to its purpose
* Functional nd vivid description - main message first. audience-focused writing. give substantiation later, at first use motivating, clear text.

set upp the app details page to show what your app is like
* screen shots are important! take many. take good ones, that deliver on promises (accurate!).
* for phones, for tablets, separately.
* video previews are the next level. video previews do increase audience.
 
 app reviews, etc, are sorted by language and country for the user.
 * think about audience. you can specify the app presentation for the proper audience subset
 
 key points:
 * creative, clear message
 * mimic real experience
 * know your audience
 
Suggestions posted based on similarity to yoyur app are not meant to be compettive to it. if someone found your app and it is a recipe app, it will show other kitchen/cooking apps, but not another recipe app.
 
####Meta data

the main meta-data they collect are:
* installs
* uninstalls
* long installs - how long the app is kept before uninstall influences rank in play store
* engagement - apps that make use of google services can help analize the use of the app

#### Top Lists

these are created _per country_, _per category_ and _per ? _

|Top Paid|Top Free|Top Gross|Top Paid New|Top Free New
--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
*Target audience*| First-Time Users ||| Focused on returning Users |
*Duration* | Lasts several days ||||
*Eligibility* | All ||| Published in last 30 days (global) |
*Generated* | Daily ||||
*Metric*  | installs || revenue | installs |

----------

There is also a _trending_ list, it attempts to guess where in your lifecycle your app is. if you are trending out of your category, you get bumped up into a trending list (it is a 30 window that it takes into account).

#### Personalization in search

* navigational queries - more local
* categorical queries - more personal
 
### Tips

#### Tablets

* there is a "designed for tablets" designation
* tablet-specific screen shots, etc
* the developer console talks about optimizations to help get the designation 

#### Publication keywords

keyowrds used by trusted review sources (for example, techcrunch) are used by google to quickly initialize the category and prominence of your app. ensuring reviewers use good, relevant words in the link text itself to your app will resultin a better outcome in this.

#### Avoid common mistakes

more than 50% of queries are misspelled

Don't name your app as a common misspelling, because the system will automcorrect people away from your app.

Target your audience.

If you have a non-google.com link, do add it on the dev console. The data gained from your dev circle will be used like the trusted sources data to initialize your app's standing/listing/

Optimize size and ram of your app: makes your app more likely to stay installed longer, promoting the standing of your app.

### Viral loop

* highly-rated app (based on people you know's reviews and +1s)
* there is a google plus api that allows an app's users to plusone the app within the app.
* integrate with google services â€” utilizing the google social connections increases google's access to your engagement

### Other Key Metrics

#### User retention

* short-term retention - how many people reach out for and install your app
* long-term retention - delivering on the promise 

#### User monetorization

active use to promote revenue.
