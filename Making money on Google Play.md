Nearly all top-grossing apps are free-to-play
- This allows the user to defer payment:
    1. acquire as many users as possible by offering free
    2. retention keep them involved and sell them on the working product
    3. monetization - there are varied successful ways to introduce monetization

#### Case study: Kiwi

* monetization: they simply promote merchandizing sales. 

#### Case study: DeNA - Blood Brothers

* acquisition: they focus on cross-promotion between their apps
* retention: provide clear objectives
* monetization: they provide rare bonuses at higher levels during events (revenue doubles during event phase)

#### Kabam

* retention is important: always be testing, and focus on core users. (balancing/implementation and engagement like blizzard) they increase content releases to keep the game fresh
* monetization:  they provide a constant access to their monteiztion options in game, so players can always shop 

#### Pandora

* acquisition: free light use, paid use on commitment
* retention is important: constantly giving more content and free hours to bring people in
* monetization: in-app billings increased purchases by about 50%, even though it was already a mature product. pandora offered a monthly free usage and only asked for money after they were over.
